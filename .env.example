# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env in the root directory
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys
# 3. Restart your development server after adding the keys
# 4. The application will automatically detect and use premium APIs when available

# Note: Without these API keys, the application will fall back to the browser's
# built-in Web Speech API, which provides basic functionality but lower quality.
